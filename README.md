## Computer-Vision---Heart-Disease-Predictions

The goal of the project is to predict the presence of heart disease in the patient

All necessary libraries for the EDA, Visualizations and ML Algorithms was imported

Exploratory Data Analysis was carried out on the data set using the Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis Techniques

A machine learning model and metric was used to predict the target with accuracy for 	Random Forest = 82%, 	K-Nearest Neighbors = 72% while	Logistic Regression = 82%
which shows that on the trained data set based on 80-20 percent split gave us 82% with both Random Forest and Linear Regression model.

That shows that there 82% of the population is prone to having a Heart disease and this can be carried on a new data set.
